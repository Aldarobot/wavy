Contributors are always welcome (thank you for being interested!), whether it
be a bug report, bug fix, feature request, feature implementation or whatever.
Don't be shy about getting involved.  I always make time to fix bugs, so usually
a patched version of the library will be out a few days after a report.
Features requests will not complete as fast.  If you have any questions, design
critques, or want me to find you something to work on based on your skill level,
you can email me at [jeronlau@plopgrizzly.com](mailto:jeronlau@plopgrizzly.com).
