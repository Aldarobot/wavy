The sound waves are _so_ wavy!  Wavy supports microphone audio recording and
speaker audio playback using S16LEx2 audio format for these platforms:

### Platforms
- Linux (Using ALSA)
- Web Browser (Compile to Web Assembly)

### Planned Platforms
- Windows
- MacOS and iOS
- BSD
- Fuchsia
- Redox
- Android (might already work)
- Nintendo Switch (and other game consoles)

### Planned Capabilities
- Audio channel mixing.
- Audio Resampling.
- Surround sound 5.1 support.
- Sound from specific direction (Radians) and volume for video games.

## Getting Started
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
pasts = "0.4"
wavy = "0.2"
```

### Example
This example records audio and plays it back in real time as it's being
recorded.  (Make sure to wear headphones to avoid feedback).

```rust,no_run
use pasts::{CvarExec, prelude::*};
use wavy::{Player, Recorder, S16LEx2};

use std::cell::RefCell;

/// Shared data between recorder and player.
struct Shared {
    /// A stereo audio buffer.
    buffer: Vec<S16LEx2>,
}

/// Create a new monitor.
async fn monitor() {
    /// Extend buffer by slice of new frames from last plugged in device.
    async fn record(shared: &RefCell<Shared>) {
        let mut recorder = Recorder::<S16LEx2>::new().unwrap();
        loop {
            let _sample_rate = recorder.fut().await;
            let shared: &mut Shared = &mut *shared.borrow_mut();
            recorder.record_last(&mut shared.buffer);
        }
    }
    /// Drain double ended queue frames into last plugged in device.
    async fn play(shared: &RefCell<Shared>) {
        let mut player = Player::<S16LEx2>::new().unwrap();
        loop {
            let _sample_rate = player.fut().await;
            let shared: &mut Shared = &mut *shared.borrow_mut();
            let n_frames = player.play_last(shared.buffer.as_slice());
            shared.buffer.drain(..n_frames.min(shared.buffer.len()));
        }
    }

    let shared = RefCell::new(Shared { buffer: Vec::new() });
    let mut record = record(&shared);
    let mut play = play(&shared);
    println!("Entering async loopâ€¦");
    [record.fut(), play.fut()].select().await;
    unreachable!()
}

/// Start the async executor.
fn main() {
    static EXECUTOR: CvarExec = CvarExec::new();

    EXECUTOR.block_on(monitor())
}
```

Don't be shy about getting involved.  I always make time to fix bugs, so usually
a patched version of the library will be out a few days after a report.
Features requests will not complete as fast.  If you have any questions, design
